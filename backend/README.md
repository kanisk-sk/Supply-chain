# Supply Chain Tracking & Analytics Systems

Production-style backend for a supply-chain tracking and analytics system.
**Stage 1** shipped the foundation: API conventions, database schema,
migrations, error handling, response envelope, health endpoint, state machines,
and the testing base. **Stage 2** ships JWT authentication + RBAC, the
Users/Suppliers/Products/Warehouses resource APIs, transactional inventory
(adjust/transfer + append-only history), LOW_STOCK alerts, audit logging, a
development seed script, and full endpoint test coverage. **Stage 3** adds the
orders → shipments lifecycle with FSM-driven processing and append-only status
history. **Stage 4** ships the live-computed analytics endpoints (overview,
inventory, shipments, suppliers, bottlenecks) and the derived-condition alert
engine — LOW_STOCK, SHIPMENT_OVERDUE — with its alerts API and an optional
in-process scheduler daemon.

## Stack

- Python 3.14, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic
- MySQL 8+ / InnoDB (`DATETIME(6)`, native ENUMs, UTF-8mb4)
- PyMySQL driver, PyJWT, bcrypt, email-validator, pytest + httpx

```

## Setup

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env        # then edit DATABASE_URL / TEST_DATABASE_URL etc.
alembic upgrade head        # create the canonical schema
python -m app.seed          # optional: dev users, suppliers, products, stock
```

The bundled `alembic/env.py` reads `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`; `alembic.ini`
does not hardcode credentials.

## Run

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

- Health check: `GET /health`
- OpenAPI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (and `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`)
- Login: `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with a seeded account (e.g. `admin@example.com / Admin123!`)

## Tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

Database-backed tests run only when MySQL is reachable and skip otherwise.
They use `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and never touch the dev database.

## Documentation

- `docs/ERD.md` — entity-relationship model
- `docs/DATABASE.md` — canonical schema, constraints, indexes
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — request lifecycle, layers, transactions, state machines
- `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` — API surface; implemented endpoints are marked **[LIVE]**

## Self-service profiles

All authenticated users can update their own profile through `PATCH /api/v1/auth/me` (name and optional `avatar_data`) and change their password through `POST /api/v1/auth/me/password` (current and new password). These endpoints do not accept another user's ID, email, role or warehouse assignment. Password changes verify the current password, and profile/password changes append audit records without storing passwords in the audit payload.

Photos are persisted as bounded JPEG data URLs in the nullable `users.avatar_data` column introduced by migration `a60206f1c001`. Run `alembic upgrade head` before starting the updated backend. The frontend accepts JPEG, PNG and WebP files up to 5 MB and resizes them to a 256px square JPEG before saving.

`GET /api/v1/auth/me` includes the account's photo and `warehouse_id`, which the role-specific frontend dashboard uses for warehouse scoping.

## Frontend and project overview

The Next.js frontend lives in `../frontend`. See the [project README](../README.md) for full-stack setup, development accounts, routes and frontend checks.

External integrations and ML are outside the current implementation.

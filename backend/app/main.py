"""FastAPI application factory.

Stage 4 scope: live-computed analytics (overview, inventory, shipments,
suppliers, bottlenecks) and a derived-conditions alert engine (LOW_STOCK,
SHIPMENT_OVERDUE) with a read-only alerts API and an optional in-process
scheduler, on top of Stages 1-3 (envelope/errors/pagination, auth/RBAC/master
data, order + shipment lifecycle). ML, a GUI, and external integrations remain
later stages.

"""Scheduled alert check: time-based SHIPMENT_OVERDUE reconciliation.

Time-based rules can flip between writes (a shipment becomes overdue simply
because the clock passes ``expected_delivery_at``). The reactive path in
``app/modules/shipments/service.py`` handles the on-write direction; this job
covers the elapsed-time direction.

It deliberately reconciles only the targeted set: the union of

- potentially overdue shipments (``expected_delivery_at < now`` and not
  DELIVERED), and
- shipments referenced by unresolved SHIPMENT_OVERDUE alerts (whose condition
  may now be false, e.g. a shipment delivered outside the reactive path).

so it never re-evaluates every alert in the database. ``run_overdue_check`` is
synchronous and safe to call from tests, the ``python -m app.jobs.scheduler``
daemon, or an optional in-process thread (``SCHEDULER_ENABLED``).

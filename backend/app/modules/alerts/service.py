"""Alert derivation: create/resolve lifecycle for derived operational conditions.

Alerts are a cache of *derived* conditions, never a source of truth (inventory
and shipment state live in their own tables). The lifecycle is:

- condition becomes true  → ensure exactly one unresolved alert exists
  (no duplicate when one is already open);
- condition becomes false → resolve all open alerts for that condition
  (``resolved_at`` is set);
- condition becomes true again later → a fresh alert row is created; the
  resolved row is kept as history.

Evaluation is reactive: the write path calls the affected reducer (e.g.
``reconcile_low_stock`` after an inventory mutation, ``reconcile_shipment_overdue``
after a shipment change) so only the touched entity is re-checked — never every
alert in the database. Time-based conditions that can flip without a write
(overdue shipments) are covered by the scheduled evaluator in ``app/jobs/``.

Clients cannot set the underlying operational condition through alerts; the API
is read-only (``app/modules/alerts/router.py``).

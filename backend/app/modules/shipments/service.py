"""Shipment business rules and transactional workflows.

The shipment lifecycle is driven purely by ``ShipmentStateMachine``:
``PACKED → IN_TRANSIT → DELIVERED``. Every valid transition appends a row to
``shipment_status_history`` (append-only, never updated). ``DELAYED`` is never
persisted — it is derived per read via :func:`app.modules.shipments.schemas.is_delayed`.

Inventory integration: ``dispatch`` is the moment goods physically leave a
warehouse. For every order line item it locks the ``(product, warehouse)`` row
FOR UPDATE, validates availability, decrements stock, and appends a
``SHIPMENT_DISPATCH`` inventory transaction — all inside one transaction by
reusing :meth:`app.modules.inventory.service.InventoryService.dispatch_stock`.
A shortage of any line rolls the whole dispatch back (shipment stays PACKED, no
history, no inventory movement, no audit). The shipment carries the full order
(no per-shipment line split exists in the schema). An order-level row lock
serializes shipment creation and dispatch; only one full-order shipment is
created and existing legacy duplicate shipments cannot both dispatch.
